- Totality is a framework for IoT solutions that, in theory, should be able to handle most if not all problems once fully flushed out;
hence the name "Totality" :-D.
- Currently it is broken into two sections: The Device Level and The Back End. Each is in it's own directory and each has it's own
README for further information.
- I recommend starting withe The Device Level then moving onto The Back End.
- I also recommend you view the system diagrams in the root dir of this repo too.
